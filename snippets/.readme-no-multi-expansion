I should be able to have:

copyright.avail
copyright.koansys

and type "copyright<TAB>" and have it suggest, but it does nothing, inserts a TAB.

I have to set the "key: copyright" in each file to get it to use them,
and it does suggest each's name.

It pops up a graphic window, not the emacs text I was expecting. See
new yas-prompt-functions, defaults to:

(yas-x-prompt yas-dropdown-prompt yas-completing-prompt yas-ido-prompt yas-no-prompt)
